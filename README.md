# hw-2-portfolio

Objective:
This is a outline of the professional portfolio. The project is to show the current HTML, and CSS skills weve have learned in our class so far. It will be added to in the future as more skills are learned or improved upon. Email and phone number are not included due to it being a public document and that is private information.

Outline:
Design of the page is to the specifications of the assignment having working navigation links. Recent picture of myself which will updated to a better photo before graduation. An about me section for an employer to learn what I enjoy and what I am passionate about. Work section that will be added to further on in the course with actual projects and work from the class. Contact information which is not actually given due to privacy of that information and it is a public document at the moment. Also are indexxed by being black text instead of white with a link.
